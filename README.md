# Monitoring road infrastructure from satellite images in Greater Maputo

Repository for the paper: "Monitoring road infrastructure from satellite images in Greater Maputo"
Published in Statistical Methods and Applications – DOI: 10.1007/s10260-024-00772-y

## Overview

Road infrastructure conditions significantly impact transport operations, yet information on pavement surface types is rarely available in developing countries. This project addresses this gap by developing an automatic classification method using:

- **Google Earth satellite images** of road networks
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** road network data
- **DBSCAN clustering** for image segmentation
- **Object-oriented k-NN classification** algorithm

The approach was validated on the Greater Maputo area in Mozambique, achieving:
- **88.1%** overall accuracy using satellite images only
- **94.5%** accuracy when including street type information
